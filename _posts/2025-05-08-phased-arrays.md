I recently became interested in phased arrays after watching [this](https://youtu.be/z4uxC7ISd-c?si=QM6bxZAGs_SjXdXq).   
From what I understand, a phased array is basically a collection of regularly spaced oscillators that, due to interference, produce (somewhat focused) beams of waves. These beams which can be steered by subtle tuning of the phase difference between the individual oscillators. If all oscillators are in phase, the beam will propagate perpendicular to the array.
This phenomenon is used for a range of tech applications, such as antenna's (electromagnetic waves), and ultrasound imaging (ultrasonic acoustic waves).
