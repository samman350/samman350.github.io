I recently became interested in phased arrays after watching [this](https://youtu.be/z4uxC7ISd-c?si=QM6bxZAGs_SjXdXq).   
A phased array is basically a collection of oscillators that, due to interference, produce beams of some kind of wave, which can be steered by subtle tuning of the phase difference between the individual oscillators. If all oscillators
This phenomenon is used for a range of tech applications like antenna's (electromagnetic waves), and ultrasound imaging (ultrasonic waves).
