Hello world! 

I write about projects that I did. I do this to have some overview of what I do, plus I want to show things to people.

Hereâ€™s what I plan to write about:

- simulations
- microcontroller projects (often sound related)
- half finished games that I made (often mobile stuff)

Thanks,

  Sam
