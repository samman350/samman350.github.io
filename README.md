Born in Amsterdam, I was educated as a physicist at University of Twente, then did a PhD in Trondheim, Norway and partially at Berkeley Labs (20 months) in CA, USA, specializing in micro- and nanoscopic magnetism. After this I remained in the Scandinavian spheres, and moved to Uppsala, Sweden to become a post doc at the Ångström Laboratory, and eventually became a researcher. I live in Uppsala with my girlfriend and my daughter. 

On this page I'd like to share projects that are for the most part unrelated to my research.
