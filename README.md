Hi! I am Sam. Born and raised in Amsterdam, then:

- studied technical physics at University of Twente, focus on material physics
- PhD in Trondheim, Norway and partially at Berkeley Labs (20 months) in CA, USA, specializing in micro- and nanoscopic magnetism;
- moved to Uppsala, Sweden to become a post doc at the Ångström Laboratory, and eventually became a researcher.

I live in Uppsala with my girlfriend and my daughter. 

On this page I'd like to share projects that are for the most part unrelated to my research.
